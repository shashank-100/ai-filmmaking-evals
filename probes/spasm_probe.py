"""spasm_probe.py — "face spasm" detector for talking-head renders (v3, silence-mouth).

WHAT THE DEFECT ACTUALLY IS (calibrated 2026-07-25, the morning stage episode): after the
last spoken word (and inside long pauses), the engine keeps the mouth and lower face
WORKING — churn with nothing being said. That violates her<->VOICE coherence in both
directions (a sung syllable implies a mouth shape; SILENCE implies a settling mouth)
and reads to a human as "her face is spasming." I caught it twice; three separate
frame-scale motion metrics (translation reversals, rotation shear, flicker index) all
scored the labeled-bad regions UNREMARKABLE — the artifact is not fast oscillation,
it is mouth activity where the audio says quiet.

Discriminability on hand-labeled takes (post/speech mouth-energy ratio):
    fix-beach  1.44  <- "there's still spasm" (the take I called out)
    fix-nook   1.00
    fix-flower 0.71
    fix-bakery 0.51
A settled ending should be well BELOW speech level.

Method: decode the mouth band (center 1/4 width, 1/7 height at 42% down — 1:1
talking-head geometry) at the clip's real fps; per-frame mean abs diff = mouth
activity; SRT sidecar gives speech spans (same audio => same cues for every take).
Score = post-speech mean / speech mean, plus the worst 1s post window and the
inter-cue-gap ratio.

Verdict: FAIL >= 0.75, WARN >= 0.50, else PASS.  Exit 0 PASS / 1 WARN / 2 FAIL.
