"""level_probe.py — does the clip hold ONE lighting level all the way through?

my spec (2026-07-26): "just bc u bright dim bright dim predictably don't mean we
pass. Passing means you gotta be like dim all the way, or bright all the way." A regular
pulse is still a failure. Constancy is the criterion, at any chosen level.

Three things must hold steady over time, because a clip can fake any one of them:
  face      her face's own level          (the engine re-lights her frame to frame)
  scene     the background's level         (exposure wander)
  relation  face minus body                (a masked grade can flatten the face average
                                            while her face still swings against her body,
                                            which is what the eye actually reads as pulsing)

Benchmarks measured on avatar_iv (the standard I set): face 4.2, scene 2.1,
relation 10.3. avatar_iii raw on a hard-rim night look: 22, 13, 24.

Level classes: dim (<70), mid (70-120), bright (>120) — both dim-all-the-way and
bright-all-the-way are valid targets; only the WANDER is the defect.

Usage: level_probe.py <video.mp4> [--json]
Exit 0 constant / 1 wandering.
