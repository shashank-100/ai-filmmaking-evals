"""sync_probe.py — does her mouth TRAIL the audio? (the lipsync axis, measured)

Built 2026-07-26 after I flagged two clips with "the lip sync is a bit off". This is the FIRST
metric all day that separates my labels, and it works because it measures the thing I named
instead of a pixel statistic the model found plausible. Nine earlier models died measuring the wrong axis.

## THE SIGNAL

Cross-correlate MOUTH-BAND motion against the AUDIO ENVELOPE and find the lag that maximises it.
Negative lag = mouth moves with or slightly ahead of the sound. Positive lag = mouth TRAILS.

    take3-final-pro   -160ms   verdict: good
    M1               -80ms   verdict: good
    F1               -40ms   verdict: good
    G1               +40ms   verdict: fine
    G4b             +120ms   verdict: "the lip sync is a bit off"
    G5b             +240ms   verdict: "the lip sync is a bit off"

My acceptable band is -160 to +40ms; my rejects are +120 and +240. LAG_MAX sits at +2 frames
(+80ms), between them. 240ms is far beyond the ~100ms where audio/video desync becomes perceptible
to a human, so the number and the eye agree here for a mechanically sensible reason.

This is also exactly avatar_iii's documented weakness ("softer lip-sync, mouth lags slightly"). So
the defect is the ENGINE's known failure mode showing up per-draw, not a look or a script problem.

## IT IS NOISY. DO NOT GATE ON IT. (added within the hour, by the stability check the model skipped)

Measuring the SAME clip in thirds shows the lag swinging 6-10 frames:

    F1 (verdict: good)  whole -1f   thirds -1 / -5 / +1
    M1 (verdict: good)  whole -2f   thirds -6 / +4 / +0
    G5b (verdict: off)  whole +6f   thirds -4 / +6 / +3
    G4c (verdict: off)  whole +5f   thirds +5 / +5 / +5

Only the last is stable. So the whole-clip figure is largely an average of noise, and the 8/8
agreement it first showed was substantially luck. It was wired into ship_gate as a BLOCKER and
downgraded to a DISCLOSURE the same hour. Report the number, never let it refuse a clip.

The one thing that might survive: G4c is CONSISTENTLY +5 across every third while the goods
OSCILLATE around zero. Consistency-of-sign could be the real signal rather than the mean. That is a
hypothesis with n=1, explicitly not implemented, and it is exactly the shape of the ten models that
have already died today. Do not build it without a much larger labelled set.

## WHAT IT IS NOT

It does not judge whether a clip is good. It judges ONE axis, the one I named. A clip can sit at
0ms and still be rejected for something else entirely; the F1-vs-G5 pair proved there is residual
per-render variance no frame metric can see. Use this to catch trailing mouths, nothing more.

Correlation strength is reported but deliberately NOT gated: it ranges 0.15-0.32 on my GOODS and
0.05-0.23 on my rejects, which overlaps. Only the LAG separates.
