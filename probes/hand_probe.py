"""hand_probe.py <video.mp4> - does she GESTURE? The axis none of the other probes measure.

Built 2026-07-26 after every timing/level/mouth meter failed to predict my "natural" calls.
My naturals (avatar_v) have visible hand gesture; the avatar_iii rejects are talking heads with hands
frozen or absent. So measure the hand/arm band directly: motion energy BELOW the shoulder line,
excluding her head, as a fraction of the head's own motion.

  gesture_ratio = (motion in the hand/arm band) / (motion in the head band)

A talking head with still hands scores near 0. A person gesturing with the words scores high.
This is deliberately NOT a naturalness verdict on its own - it is the missing INPUT that the
state<->movement pair (INVARIANTS #10) needs, since "her movement" was never being measured.
