"""mirror_probe.py — does the scene ping-pong, and is the answer even measurable?

Mechanical replacement for "render the slit-scan and have the operator read it". That older
shape held the clip and asked me to look, which is the step that gets rationalised at 4am;
this one decides. (Distinct from arrow_probe.py, which tracks HER apparent scale over time;
this one looks for the scene replaying itself.)

## The mechanism it measures (established 2026-07-26, two clips, exact integers)

avatar_iii generates roughly 26-30s of scene motion and then FILLS the remaining duration by
playing that segment forward, backward, forward. So the background repeats exactly with a
period of twice the generated length, and the mirror vertices land on odd multiples of half
the period:

    iii 131s take A: repeat period 60s, mirror vertices measured at 30, 60, 90
    iii 131s take B: repeat period 53s, mirror vertices measured at 26.6, 53.3, 106.7
    iv  131s:        no repeat at any period (best 74% of the unrelated-frame distance)

That is why water runs backwards past the half-period, why a clip at or under ~30s is clean
(it never reaches the first vertex), and why my read was right: it reuses its own source
signal. Two detectors follow, and REPEAT is the sensitive one:

  REPEAT  frame(t) vs frame(t+P) over a sweep of P. An exact refill scores near zero.
  MIRROR  frame(v-d) vs frame(v+d) over several lags d at once. A plain forward loop can only
          match at the single lag d=P/2, so agreement across many small lags means the repeat
          is genuinely mirrored rather than merely looped.

## Two rules learned by getting it wrong the same night

  1. SIGNAL FLOOR. A region only votes if its own control clears CONTROL_FLOOR. The model once probed
     a nearly-static band, got a control of 0.6 (no signal at all), read "no reversal", and
     reported a 131s iii take as the first clean two-minute one. It ping-ponged at t=80.
     A dead band cannot exonerate a clip, so a frame too static to measure is UNJUDGEABLE,
     never a pass.
  2. MATCHED SPANS. Controls compare frames the SAME distance apart as the test does.
     Comparing a 3-frame gap against a 1-frame baseline made a true single take fail its own
     control earlier that night (see seam_check.py, same lesson).

Her face is excluded from the scene measurement on purpose: a mouth is periodic, and speech
periodicity reads as a loop if you let it into the band. That false positive flagged a clip
I had approved.

## Thresholds (derived, never authored)

Measured on the labelled set: rejects 0.00 and 0.15 of the unrelated-frame distance; the iv
benchmark 0.74; the 26s take I approved has no period at all. REPEAT_REJECT sits at 0.40,
between the worst pass and the best fail. MIRROR_REJECT 0.22 sits between the iii rejects
(0.02-0.14) and the iv benchmark (0.31-0.41).
