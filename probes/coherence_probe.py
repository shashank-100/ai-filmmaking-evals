"""coherence_probe.py — temporal triple-coherence instrument (v1, graph-with-state).

WHAT IT MEASURES: the defect the eye catches as "robotic": motion that merely
co-occurs with the words instant-by-instant instead of living as a trajectory —
constant churn with no rest, no articulated onsets, bursts unanchored to prosody.
Pairwise-at-an-instant cannot see this; it is a temporal-triple property
(motion_t x words_t x motion_t+1), so the probe walks the clip as a graph:
nodes = speech events (SRT cue onsets + prosodic RMS peaks), edges = pairwise
axes, and a STATE dict carried node-to-node (motion regime, phase debt) supplies
the third leg. Scripted video means the future is known: every upcoming onset
comes from the SRT, so "actions lead the words" is a deterministic check.

Components and their CALIBRATION STATUS (26-take labeled matrix, 2026-07-25):
  rest_fraction   share of the speech window spent in sustained head-band rest
                  (runs >= 0.25s below threshold). CALIBRATED and gating: the r16
                  human anchor lands 0.116 at REST_LEVEL 0.38; takes I called
                  robotic sit low (smooth-beach 0.007, regen-beach 0.000) and my
                  tune-down round measurably raised it (smooth-bakery 0.065 ->
                  human-bakery 0.106). KNOWN CONFOUND: the head band is a fixed
                  crop, so moving backgrounds (surf, street bustle) leak motion
                  and depress rest on outdoor scenes; a face-tracked crop (the
                  Vision tracker instrument) is the fix. Interpret outdoor FLAGs
                  with the eye. Also: rest measures the constant-motion defect
                  ONLY — the rejected calm wave PASSES rest (0.11-0.15) because
                  it was rejected for framing/register, a different defect class.
  prosody_lock    share of motion bursts starting within +-0.5s of a speech
                  event. SATURATED in v1 (0.84-1.00 on every take: events are so
                  dense that any burst trivially locks). Printed, NOT gating.
  phase           per-event motion-onset timing vs its event. SATURATED in v1
                  (every take reads a uniform ~-0.45s "lead": the onset detector
                  finds the previous burst, not an event-tied onset). Needs
                  word-level alignment before it means anything. Printed, NOT
                  gating.
  continuous      events with no articulated onset because motion never rested
                  beforehand — the "always moving" tell, counted per node.

Verdict v1: FLAG iff rest_fraction < 0.10. Diagnostic only: the eye outranks;
this joins the gate as a pre-filter, never a verdict on taste.

Usage: coherence_probe.py <clip.mp4> <sidecar.srt> [--json] [--rest-only]
       --rest-only: clips with music beds (RMS peaks unusable); rest axis only.
Exit 0 PASS / 1 FLAG.
