# Block renders that use a voice or avatar which is not the PINNED clone.
# "her" throughout refers to the rendered character; see the README disclosure.
#
# WHY (2026-07-27: "everything must use cloned voice and cloned avatar
# hard config PINNED down" / "can we harden this voice miss!"). On 2026-07-27 a
# 2-minute training render shipped in the WRONG voice. The pins live in prose
# across the pipeline spec and the golden-set spec, and the assistant read a value out of a
# STALE dated BACKUP COPY of the spec instead of the live file, using
# <pinned-voice-id> (two generations old) on the wrong model with the wrong
# settings and a single blind TTS draw. Prose cannot stop that. This can.
#
# Source of truth: the pin file at $IDENTITY_PINS (see README).
#
# What is blocked:
#   1. Any ElevenLabs text-to-speech call whose voice id is not the pinned one.
#      Superseded ids get a louder message naming which generation they are.
#   2. Any HeyGen create_video_* call whose avatar id is neither the pinned base
#      avatar nor a look inside her avatar group (so FRESH looks still pass, a
#      foreign or stock avatar does not).
#
# What is deliberately NOT blocked:
#   - Reading, grepping or editing files that merely CONTAIN old ids (docs,
#     backups, memory, this hook, pins.json itself). Only outbound calls.
#   - The metered voice entrypoint, which reads the pin itself and is sanctioned.
#
# Escape hatch, deliberately manual: touch /tmp/.identity-pin-bypass (120s TTL).
# Use only when I explicitly ask to revert to a previous clone.

# ---------- 3. avatar carried by a RAW HTTP CALL (Bash egress) ----------
# Coverage gap, closed 2026-07-28. Check 2 keys on the MCP TOOL NAME, so a curl to
# the vendor REST API from Bash carried an avatar id that nothing ever inspected.
# The voice check above scans ANY payload, so the voice pin was enforced on every
# egress path while the avatar pin was enforced on exactly one. Same pin, same
# verdict, now the same coverage. This matters because the caller is a language
# model: the pipeline spec itself tells it to fall back to curl when an MCP tool is not on
# the allowlist, and the stage scripts grant Bash.
#
# Scope, deliberately narrow: a JSON avatar_id in a payload aimed at the vendor
# API host. Backslashes are stripped first because tool_input arrives re-encoded,
# so the body reads \"avatar_id\" rather than "avatar_id". Keyed on the avatar_id
# FIELD, never on bare 32-char tokens, so a video_id or asset_id cannot false-trip.
