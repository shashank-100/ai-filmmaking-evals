#
# MECHANICAL pre-delivery gate. Born 2026-07-25 after I caught the same two
# regression classes AGAIN on a delivered clip (letterbox borders; backward ocean):
# both were pre-warned in prop_gate PROSE and skipped under momentum. Lessons kept
# as prose regress; lessons kept as blocking mechanisms do not (prop_gate attest,
# the pre-publish gate in tools/). prop_gate guards the LOOK before the render spend; this
# guards the RENDER before delivery - the stage that had no mechanical check.
#
# Checks, in order:
#   1. GEOMETRY  - content band must fill >= 90% of frame height (letterbox = FAIL;
#                  the fix is a fit=cover re-render, never shipping borders).
#   2. SPASM     - spasm_probe FAIL (exit 2) blocks. WARN prints for the eye.
#   3. COHERENCE - rest/lock/phase printed; FLAG prints for the eye (outdoor
#                  confound means rest alone never hard-blocks here).
#   4. ARROW     - if "directional" is passed (water/traffic/crowd scenes): builds
#                  a slit-scan x-t image and EXITS 3 demanding an eye-read. Rerun
#                  with --arrow-ok only after actually reading the slit-scan
#                  (forward flow = one-way slope; palindrome V = ping-pong REJECT).
#
# On pass: writes /tmp/.ship-gate-<basename>-<bytes> marker. deliver.sh refuses
# files without a fresh marker, so skipping this gate is not possible by forgetting.
